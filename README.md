# Random Beer Generator ala Punk API

LOL

Dear reader,

This simple React App will present you with a random beer from Punk API (linked below)

## Installation

Download the project to your computer and navigate over to that folder

You will need node installed and your choice of package handler (I used npm)

'''bash
npm start
'''

## What Next?

Once you hit npm start a browser window should pop up at http://localhost:3000


## Appreciation

Thank you to Punk API for having such a friendly API!
