The Not So Google Form!

npm start

React Base
Uses bootstrap

This can go two ways

A) Build a simple form that is responsive and allows the user to receive the form they have filled out.

B) Allow the user to build a form that they can send out and
    i) it autopopulates something like an invite?
    ii) it sends said form to person?
