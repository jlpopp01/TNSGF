# Random Beer Generator ala Punk API

Dear reader,

This simple React App will present you with a random beer from Punk API (linked below). It uses Axios to help fetch the data. React-Bootstrap and some CSS to make it beautiful.

## Installation

Download the project to your computer and navigate over to that folder

You will need node installed and your choice of package handler (I used npm)

npm start

## What Next?

Once you hit npm start a browser window should pop up at http://localhost:3000

Refresh the page (command/ctrl + r) and you will be presented with a new beer.


## Appreciation

Thank you to Punk API for having such a friendly API!
